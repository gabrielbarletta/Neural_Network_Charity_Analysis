# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  - Is-Successful column. 
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  - NAME, APPLICATION, TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT,SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, STATUS, and ASK_AMT
-What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  -The EIN, NAME, STATUS, and SPECIAL_CONSIDERATION columns are neither targets nor features.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  -
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - I only achieved an accuracy of 72% and was not able to achieve the target model performance.
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
  -I tried to increase the model performance by dropping more columns,
## Summary
- The deep learning neural network model did not reach the target of 75% accuracy.
